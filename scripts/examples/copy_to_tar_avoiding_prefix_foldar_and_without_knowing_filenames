# tar remembers the older hierarchy of specified files and compresses them in same topology.
# If you don't know all the files and want to specify them with wildcard - you can do it with * .
# Bash will simply substitute * with appropriate files.

# If you need to avoid the highermost folder(s) in tarfile hierarchy, you can specify the prefix to 
# tar with -C $folder  and then list the files without $folder/... before them.

# Another solution is to cd to folder, tar it, and go back, but this doesn't allow to pass all 
# files as snaemake {input}, because they are specified with preceding $folder/ thing.

# But both things - avoid parent folder and also specify files with * - don't work simultaneously.
# Bash can no longer expand the asterisc when files are specified not properly from head directory.
# The solution is to use -C $folder and pass files from ls output:
#    tar -czf file.tar.gz -C $folder $(ls $folder/)

# In the example above I have to avoid the set name, that I don't want in my tar, and also I don't know in advance
# For this I copy needed report files from main sample dir into temp dir, 
# tar them when I precisely know they hierarchy, and delete temp dir.
