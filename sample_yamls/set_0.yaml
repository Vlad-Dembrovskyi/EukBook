    - set_0 # set with highest Euk content, even higher than in set_1, 
            # but only because it is mainly coral or duck DNA as Euk.

    # added last two just to keep the order of samples devisable by 10. Set 1 started from 9-th sample in sorted table of 4581 accessions, so remained only 8 for set one. Two more complete the number to 10 and set_4 will start from accession 41.
